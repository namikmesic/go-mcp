# Feature Request: Architect Mode and Developer Modes

## Overview

This feature request proposes adding specialized operational modes to go-mcp that bridge the gap between architectural vision and implementation by creating a structured, AI-augmented workflow between architects and developers. By establishing a shared context and intelligent constraints, the system ensures that AI-assisted development remains aligned with architectural intent while preserving developer autonomy and accountability.

## Background

The emergence of AI-assisted development has created several significant challenges in software engineering workflows:

1. **Developer Effectiveness with AI**: Many developers struggle to effectively leverage AI tools, often due to difficulties in managing context and formulating effective prompts.

2. **Amplification of Individual Preferences**: AI tends to amplify the architectural preferences of individual developers, potentially creating inconsistency and divergence from intended architectural direction.

3. **Tracking Progress in Accelerated Workflows**: Traditional progress tracking methods (Jira tickets, status meetings) are poorly suited to the rapid pace of AI-assisted development.

4. **Communication of Architectural Intent**: Architectural decisions and constraints are typically communicated through documentation that is often ignored or misinterpreted during implementation.

5. **Balancing Guidance and Autonomy**: Providing sufficient architectural direction without overly constraining developer creativity and problem-solving remains a difficult balance.

These challenges create a situation where AI-assisted development often moves quickly but in directions that may not align with the organization's architectural vision, leading to increased technical debt and architectural drift.

## Feature Description

The Architect Mode and Developer Modes feature would:

1. **Provide Role-Based Operational Modes**: Create distinct interfaces and capabilities for architects and developers that reflect their different responsibilities and concerns.

2. **Enable Architectural Intent Definition**: Allow architects to define constraints, interfaces, and design decisions that are automatically integrated into developer environments.

3. **Create Specialized MCP Agents**: Generate specialized Machine Coding Pairs (MCPs) that embody and enforce architectural constraints while assisting developers.

4. **Establish Shared Context**: Maintain a shared contextual understanding between architects and developers about the "why" behind decisions.

5. **Support Bidirectional Feedback**: Track changes and facilitate communication between developers and architects about emerging requirements or implementation challenges.

## Proposed Implementation

### 1. Architect Mode

Add a new operational mode for technical leads and architects:

```
go-mcp architect-mode /path/to/project
```

Key capabilities would include:

- **Interface Definition**: Define key interfaces, contracts, and interaction patterns that implementations must adhere to.

```go
// Define a core interface with architectural constraints
go-mcp define-interface /path/to/project --name=PaymentProcessor --constraints="stateless,idempotent,max-latency=300ms"
```

- **Constraint System**: Specify both technical and business constraints that implementations must satisfy.

```go
// Define constraints for a specific component
go-mcp define-constraints /path/to/project --component=PaymentService --constraints-file=constraints.yaml
```

Example constraints.yaml:
```yaml
architectural:
  patterns:
    - circuit_breaker
    - retry_with_backoff
  dependencies:
    allowed:
      - "github.com/org/core/logging"
      - "github.com/org/core/metrics"
    prohibited:
      - "github.com/org/legacy/*"
business:
  requirements:
    - "Must handle transaction volumes of 1000 TPS"
    - "Must support multiple payment providers through adapter pattern"
    - "Must maintain PCI compliance by not storing card details"
  context:
    - "This replaces the legacy payment system that had reliability issues"
    - "European regulations require specific transaction verification flows"
```

- **Context Injection**: Create rich context descriptions that explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

```go
// Add architectural context to a component
go-mcp add-context /path/to/project --component=PaymentService --context-file=payment_context.md
```

- **Task Definition**: Define implementation tasks with clear boundaries and acceptance criteria.

```go
// Define a development task with architectural guidance
go-mcp define-task /path/to/project --name="Implement Stripe Adapter" --interfaces=["PaymentProcessor"] --constraints=["adapter-pattern", "no-blocking-calls"]
```

### 2. Developer Mode

Add a developer-focused operational mode:

```
go-mcp developer-mode /path/to/project --task="Implement Stripe Adapter"
```

Key capabilities would include:

- **Constraint-Aware Assistance**: Provide AI assistance that respects and enforces the architectural constraints.

```go
// Get assistance that respects architectural constraints
go-mcp assisted-implementation /path/to/project --task="Implement Stripe Adapter"
```

- **Context-Rich Environment**: Preload development environments with the architectural context and reasoning.

```go
// Generate a context-rich prompt for external AI tools
go-mcp generate-context /path/to/project --task="Implement Stripe Adapter" --format=prompt
```

- **Compliance Checking**: Validate implementations against architectural constraints.

```go
// Check if implementation meets architectural constraints
go-mcp check-compliance /path/to/project --component=StripeAdapter
```

Example output:
```
Compliance Check Results:
✅ Follows adapter pattern
✅ No blocking calls detected
✅ Respects interface contract
⚠️ May exceed latency constraint under high load
❌ Uses prohibited dependency: "github.com/org/legacy/httpclient"
```

- **Architectural Guidance**: Provide direct access to architectural reasoning and context during development.

```go
// Query architectural reasoning 
go-mcp ask-architect /path/to/project --question="Why must this component be stateless?"
```

### 3. Specialized MCP Generator

Create infrastructure for generating and maintaining specialized Machine Coding Pair agents:

```
go-mcp generate-mcp /path/to/project --role=architect --name="PaymentSystemArchitect"
```

This would:
- Analyze the codebase using go-mcp's capabilities
- Incorporate architectural constraints and context
- Generate a specialized MCP that embodies the architectural vision
- Provide an interaction interface for developers to consult

Example interaction:
```
Developer: "I need to implement retry logic for payment processing. What approach should I use?"

PaymentSystemArchitect: "Based on our architectural constraints, you should use the centralized retry framework in 'github.com/org/core/retry' rather than implementing custom logic. This ensures consistent backoff behavior and centralized monitoring of retries. The main payment processor interface should remain unaware of retries - they should be handled in the adapter implementation layer.

Here's how this was implemented in the existing Paypal adapter:
[Example code with explanation]

Remember that all payment operations must be idempotent to support this retry pattern."
```

### 4. Change Impact Analyzer

Add capabilities for architects to track implementation changes against the architectural vision:

```
go-mcp analyze-changes /path/to/project --since=last-week
```

This would:
- Identify changes to the codebase
- Assess impact on architectural patterns and constraints
- Flag potential architectural drift
- Provide insights on emerging patterns

Example output:
```markdown
# Architectural Impact Analysis

## New Implementation Patterns
- Circuit breaker pattern consistently applied across 3 new service implementations
- Emerging use of Event Sourcing in inventory management components

## Potential Architectural Drift
- Payment service implementations showing increasing direct coupling to database
- Authentication logic becoming duplicated across multiple services

## Interface Violations
- OrderProcessor implementation no longer satisfies latency constraints
- UserAuthentication implementations inconsistent in error handling

## Suggested Actions
- Consider formalizing the Event Sourcing pattern for data-intensive services
- Review database access patterns in payment services
- Update OrderProcessor interface requirements or optimize implementation
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Alignment with Architectural Vision**: Ensure AI-assisted development stays aligned with organizational architectural direction.

2. **Developer Empowerment**: Help developers use AI more effectively by providing rich context and clear constraints.

3. **Accelerated Onboarding**: Enable new developers to quickly understand both the "how" and "why" of architectural decisions.

4. **Reduction in Technical Debt**: Prevent architectural drift by enforcing constraints during the development process.

5. **Improved Communication**: Create a structured communication channel between architects and developers based on code artifacts rather than abstract documentation.

6. **Preserved Developer Accountability**: Maintain developer ownership of implementation while providing appropriate guardrails.

7. **Evolving Architecture**: Provide architects with tools to identify emerging patterns and adjust architectural direction accordingly.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Constraint Expressiveness**: Design a constraint language that is both expressive enough to capture architectural intent and precise enough for automated validation.

2. **Integration with Development Environments**: Ensure seamless integration with popular IDEs and AI coding assistants.

3. **Balancing Flexibility and Control**: Find the right balance between restricting implementations to maintain architectural integrity and allowing developer creativity.

4. **Versioning of Architectural Intent**: Develop mechanisms for versioning architectural decisions and constraints alongside code.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Design the system to provide value even when partially adopted within an organization.

## Example Use Case

A team is developing a new payment processing system:

1. The architect defines the core `PaymentProcessor` interface, including constraints around idempotency, observability, and error handling.

2. The architect injects context about why specific design decisions were made, such as the need for a provider-agnostic design to support future payment methods.

3. The architect defines implementation tasks for specific payment providers.

4. Developers use Developer Mode to implement the adapters for specific payment providers.

5. As they work, developers can consult the specialized PaymentArchitect MCP about implementation questions.

6. The system validates their implementations against the architectural constraints.

7. The architect uses the Change Impact Analyzer to track emerging patterns across implementations and adjusts the architecture accordingly.

8. The team achieves a consistent implementation that meets both business needs and architectural requirements, without requiring constant meetings or extensive documentation.

## Analysis

### What Makes This Approach Powerful

1. **Bridges the AI Guidance Gap**  
   This approach addresses a critical gap in current AI-assisted development: the lack of architectural guidance. While AI tools excel at generating code, they typically lack understanding of organizational context and architectural intent. By embedding this context directly into the development workflow, this feature ensures AI becomes an amplifier of architectural vision rather than a source of drift.

2. **Creates a Structured Knowledge Transfer Mechanism**  
   Traditional methods of communicating architectural decisions (documents, meetings, wikis) are often ignored or forgotten during implementation. This approach embeds architectural knowledge directly into the developer's workflow, making it accessible precisely when needed and in the context where it's most relevant.

3. **Transforms the AI Narrative**  
   Rather than positioning AI as a replacement for developers, this approach firmly establishes AI as an augmentation tool that enhances both developer productivity and architectural compliance. It preserves developer agency and accountability while providing powerful assistance.

4. **Enables Continuous Architectural Refinement**  
   By systematically tracking emerging patterns and implementation challenges, this approach creates a feedback loop that allows architecture to evolve based on implementation realities rather than theoretical ideals. This bridges the traditional gap between architectural vision and practical implementation.

5. **Scales Architectural Influence**  
   In traditional organizations, architectural guidance is limited by the availability of architects. This approach allows architectural knowledge to scale across the organization, ensuring consistent guidance even when architects aren't directly available.

### Implementation Challenges to Consider

1. **Constraint Formalization**  
   Creating a constraint system that is expressive enough to capture architectural intent but precise enough for automated validation presents significant technical challenges. The system must balance formal verification capabilities with pragmatic flexibility.

2. **Cultural Adoption**  
   This approach represents a significant shift in how architects and developers interact. Organizations with strongly entrenched development cultures may resist the more structured workflow, potentially viewing it as limiting developer autonomy.

3. **Keeping Pace with AI Advancement**  
   As AI coding capabilities advance rapidly, maintaining relevant constraints and guidance systems that work with these evolving tools will require continuous refinement.

4. **Context Integration**  
   Seamlessly integrating architectural context into various development environments and tools without creating friction in developer workflows will be technically challenging but essential for adoption.

### Potential Industry Impact

This approach could fundamentally transform how software architecture is practiced in AI-augmented organizations:

- **Architecture as Code**: Move beyond documentation-based architecture to executable architectural constraints and context, making architecture a living, enforceable part of the development process.

- **Scalable Architectural Guidance**: Enable architectural vision to scale effectively across large organizations without requiring direct architect involvement in every decision.

- **Reduced Implementation Gap**: Significantly narrow the traditional gap between architectural intent and implementation reality by providing continuous feedback in both directions.

- **AI Governance Framework**: Establish a practical model for governing AI use in development that maintains organizational standards without stifling innovation.

- **Evolved Role Definitions**: Create clearer, more productive role definitions for architects and developers in the age of AI, focusing architects on defining constraints and context rather than reviewing implementations.

By addressing the fundamental challenges of maintaining architectural integrity in AI-accelerated development, this feature could establish a new paradigm for software architecture that is more practical, adaptable, and effective than traditional approaches.
